Horizontal Rule
--------
You can produce a horizontal rule tag by placing three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves.

Headers
--------
Markdown supports two styles of headers, Setext and atx.

Setext-style headers are “underlined” using equal signs (for first-level headers) and dashes (for second-level headers). 
For example:

This is an H1
=============
This is an H2
-------------

Atx-style headers use 1-6 hash characters at the start of the line, corresponding to header levels 1-6.  
For example:

# This is an H1
## This is an H2
### This is an H3
#### This is an H4
##### This is an H5
###### This is an H6

Line Breaks
--------
Can't newline directly, you can fill two spaces in the back on a line of text, so the next line of text will be a new line.
